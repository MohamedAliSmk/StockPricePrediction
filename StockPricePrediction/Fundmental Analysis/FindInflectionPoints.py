# after I started working through the algorithm
# it became clear it's not so different than convolution
# and convolution might be easier and faster so shifted 
# to using the built in scipy.signal library
# The signal still needs to be stationary (rotated to x axis) in time
# and for stocks because of inflation you'll need a log index or the 
# older ones will be too small to catch 
# to find the bottoms of the Nasdad flip signal around the x axis and 
# repeat


# import data that we've rotated to x axis to make stationary in time (see section 1 of above paper)
# and scaled by taking the log
